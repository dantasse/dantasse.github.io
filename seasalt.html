I went to CHI 2011 and saw some papers about games. I'd been reading a lot of <a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/">Lost Garden</a> too, and I thought I had it all figured out. Games are just a learning curve. The more smoothly you progress along it, the more fun it is. I had developed an online game that would be a ton of fun even though the skills you're learning are dumb little text-manipulation bits, and we'd be able to measure different people's engagement on different versions with and without this ideal learning curve.

Surprisingly enough, it's not that easy.

We didn't get the expected results, and my summer at the University of Washington was ending, so we had to leave this undone. Nevertheless, here are some trimmings from this project.<br/>
