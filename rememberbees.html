<h2>RememberBees</h2>
<p>
It's happened hundreds of times: you're introduced to someone and, five seconds later, you've forgotten their name. RememberBees, an Android app, aims to fix that. When you meet someone, you hit your phone. It then buzzes you a few times over the next few minutes, each time reminding you to rehearse the person's name.
