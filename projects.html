<h3>Generating neighborhood guides from social media data</h3>
Imagine you're traveling to a new city and trying to rent a place to stay. What neighborhood will you stay in? What area feels right for you? I'm building neighborhood guides based on the social media that people are posting there already. <a href="docs/social_media_neighborhood_guides_proposal.pdf">PhD Thesis Proposal</a>, the much more interesting <a href="docs/social_media_neighborhood_guides_proposal_talk.pdf">talk</a>, and the <a href="docs/generating_neighborhood_guides_citylab2016.pdf">ICWSM 2016 Citylab workshop paper</a>.

<h4>Why do people geotag?</h4>
  People post their locations on their tweets, checkins, photos - why? We went to investigate that, and ended up finding some other weird nuggets in the world of geotagging today. Paper called "State of the Geotags: Motivations and Recent Changes" at ICWSM 2017.

<h4>Our House, in the Middle of Our Tweets</h4>
  If you have someone's geotagged tweet stream, how well can you find their home? About 80% of people within 1km. At ICWSM 2016.

<h4>Radiohead or Horse_Ebooks?</a></h4>
  Alas, <a href="//www.twitter.com/horse_ebooks">@horse_ebooks</a> is no longer a seller of equine .epubs, but for a while it was one of the most wonderfully cryptic things on the internet. This is my little tribute to both the old horse and an equally cryptic band. <a href="http://radiohead-or-horse-ebooks.appspot.com/">Test your own knowledge.</a>
