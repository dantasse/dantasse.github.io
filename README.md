Well, here is my website. Some props:

- Modernizr
- Jekyll http://jekyllrb.com/
- config.yml from Asymmetrical View http://asymmetrical-view.com/2009/05/14/starting-wtih-jekyll.html
- Bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
- http://24ways.org/2012/how-to-make-your-site-look-half-decent/
- http://designshack.net/articles/css/10-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy/

## Memo to my future self

To keep this thing going:
[github pages docs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#keeping-your-site-up-to-date-with-the-github-pages-gem)

Last time I did this (2017-11-29) the magic words were:
```
bundle update
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
