Gimlets: Making Machine Learning Classification of Sensor Data Easier
</p>
<p>
Machine learning classification of sensor data is powerful- it lets you build systems to do activity recognition, stress detection, emotion recognition, and a lot of other tasks (especially physiological ones). But it's hard for non-experts to build classifiers. We built and user-tested Gimlets to understand why it's difficult and what features could help future systems.
