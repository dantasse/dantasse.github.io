<h1>
Using Public Geotagged Social Media Data to Better Understand Cities
</h1>
It's important to understand where people go in a city, but gathering that data is hard. Census data is rare and expensive, cell phone call logs are imprecise and proprietary, installing phone apps doesn't scale. Social media, though, provides a ton of free public geotagged data. How can we use that to help city planners improve cities, help businesses understand customers, and help individuals understand their city better?
<h2>
Work in progress (as of October 2014)
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Determining how accurately we can tell where someone lives and works, and how they commute, based on their geotagged tweets - collecting data via surveys for this as of Oct/Nov 2014, so if you get a tweet from @CMUChimps, it's legit.</li>
  <li>Showing businesses more about their customers by highlighting tweets from people who have tweeted there</li>
  <li>Understanding people's activity bubbles in their movement around a city, to help discover new places and people</li>
  <li>Gathering more data, from Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, and Foursquare</li>
</ul>
