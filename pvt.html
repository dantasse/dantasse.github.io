<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_vigilance_task">Psychomotor Vigilance Task</a>, or PVT, is a well established test of sleepiness. Currently, to do it, you have to buy a box from the 80's that costs hundreds of dollars. I helped some UW researchers in programming an Android app to make this test available to anyone.
